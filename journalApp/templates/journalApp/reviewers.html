                                        that MDPI maintains the highest quality
                                        standards for its published papers. All manuscripts submitted to our
                                        journals are strictly and thoroughly peer-reviewed
                                        by experts.

                                        Immediately after submission, the journal’s Managing Editor will perform a
                                        technical pre-check of the manuscript. A
                                        suitable academic editor will be notified of the submission and invited to
                                        perform an editorial pre-check and recommend
                                        reviewers. Academic editors can decide to continue with the peer review
                                        process, reject a manuscript, or request
                                        revisions before peer-review. In the case of continuing the peer review
                                        process, the Editorial Office will organize the
                                        peer review, which is performed by independent experts, and collect at least
                                        two review reports per manuscript. We ask
                                        authors for sufficient revisions (with a second round of peer review, when
                                        necessary) before a final decision is made.
                                        The final decision is made by an academic editor (usually the
                                        Editor-in-Chief/Editorial Board Member of a journal or the
                                        Guest Editor of a Special Issue). Accepted manuscripts are then copy-edited
                                        and English-edited internally. More details
                                        about the editorial process can be found here. A brochure for the reviewers

                                    <p>Submitted papers should be written in good English and require no more than
                                        minor English editing before publication.
                                        Your paper could be returned to you at the English editing stage of the
                                        publication process if extensive editing is
                                        required, which could delay the publication of your work. You may choose to
                                        use a paid language-editing service, such as
                                        MDPI's Author Services, before submitting your paper for publication. If you
                                        use an alternative service that provides a
                                        confirmation certificate, please send a copy to the Editorial Office.

                                        nations should consider registration with AuthorAid, a global research
